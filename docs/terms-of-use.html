            <h2>2. User Content</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for the content (text, URLs, etc.) you enter into the App to generate QR codes. Since the App processes this data locally, **the Company has no knowledge or control** over the generated content.</p>

            <h2>3. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

            <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, data, or other intangibles, resulting from your use or inability to use the App.</p>

            <h2>5. Changes to the Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by posting the new Terms on our website.</p>

            <h2>6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
